    "# Cascade Error Correction Protocol Demonstration\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Cascade Error Correction Protocol** used in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). \n",
    "\n",
    "In QKD protocols like BB84, quantum transmission over a channel inevitably introduces noise (Quantum Bit Error Rate - QBER). Before a secure key can be used for encryption, Alice and Bob must perform **Information Reconciliation** to ensure their keys match exactly, while minimizing the information leaked to an eavesdropper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Sifting**: Discarding bits where Alice and Bob used different bases.\n",
    "2. **QBER Estimation**: Publicly revealing a small subset of bits to estimate the error rate.\n",
    "3. **Cascade**: A multi-pass block-parity protocol that corrects bit-flip errors.\n",
